# Data-Driven-Analysis-of-Sympatric-Speciation

Xiaoyang Song's UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program) research project about exploring sympatric speciation in marine environment using a purely data-driven analysis.

Please check out partial source codes and analysis results (including symposium presentation slides) of Xiaoyang Song's UROP research "Data-driven Analysis of Sympatric Speciation". The datasets and the source codes for our models of range overlap are kept as private at this moment. Those will be posted soon after further polishing. For the rest of the source code and the datasets, please feel free to email me via xysong25@gmail.com.

### Keywords: Data analysis, Mathematical modeling, Biology, Statistical modeling, etc.
