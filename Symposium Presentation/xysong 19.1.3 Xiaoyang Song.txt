00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.719
Xiaoyang Song: Okay, this is my presentation video um let's get started.

2
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.200
Xiaoyang Song: Hello everyone, this is shelly oh and i'm currently a junior student majoring in mathematics and data science.

3
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.750
Xiaoyang Song: Today i'm going to be talking about my Europe research project a sin Patrick speciation more importantly Indian Ocean.

4
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.270
Xiaoyang Song: Okay let's start it.

5
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:41.910
Xiaoyang Song: So before we jump into the material let's think about what what are different, what are different between the terrestrial environment and the American Government.

6
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:56.730
Xiaoyang Song: In the terrestrial environment there exists lots of heart barriers, like the mountain the ocean, and so the job graphic escalation is really easy to form and.

7
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.140
Xiaoyang Song: Also on the land there and the resource or rage and they're also.

8
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.970
Xiaoyang Song: hike up the habitat a cell phone with high complexity, however, in the marine environment.

9
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:36.150
Xiaoyang Song: there's it's really hard to imagine the existence of such a absolute barriers, because of the ocean Kurt ocean current and the fluidity of the ocean and more over many larvae so invertebrates has strong disperse up entities so and it's reasonable to expect morrison PETRA in the ocean.

10
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.490
Xiaoyang Song: So let's look at some definitions first, so the definitions for Patrick speciation sin Patrick speciation are given below are given as the foley.

11
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.790
Xiaoyang Song: To put it in, to put it in short.

12
00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:02.580
Xiaoyang Song: Patrick speciation requires geographic isolation mouse and Patrick test out that's the main difference between this time there's two types of speciation mechanisms.

13
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:15.420
Xiaoyang Song: So yeah our study with beer to of data set which includes sister species pairs and age and the aging information for each species pairs.

14
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:27.300
Xiaoyang Song: Actually, out of those Informations are extracted by interpreting the fellow generic trees on the picture on the right hand side is a example of evolutionary tree.

15
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.400
Xiaoyang Song: We can see that.

16
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:46.260
Xiaoyang Song: there's two species are actually the sister species pair that we are interested in male the number label on the branch of the tree represents represents the age of the species.

17
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.380
Xiaoyang Song: And also posts on the wrench data of species, you know our data set and those data are retrieved from the obese open data set.

18
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.650
Xiaoyang Song: Okay us for our methodologies after building up a data set of marine species.

19
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.400
Xiaoyang Song: We compare the range over labs based on the following procedures were algorithms.

20
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:30.480
Xiaoyang Song: And the first 35 discuss of outliers and then compute arrange overlap computing the comics so data points and intersected areas of two species, then we use the test formula which is really important for our study to compare the range overlap for two species.

21
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:41.790
Xiaoyang Song: So here are two examples of how we compute the average overlap so first let's focus on the left hand side, we can see.

22
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:58.530
Xiaoyang Song: The blue point and the red points represent two doctorates have two different species, we can see well i'm just the blue species is merely distributed in the West Atlantic the rare species.

23
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.540
Xiaoyang Song: are distributed.

24
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:15.090
Xiaoyang Song: On the legacy investor Pacific so as it's really obvious from the map that that the shares no common habitats so it's really a natural, to say the orange over that myself is to.

25
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.810
Xiaoyang Song: hover on the right hand side stairs and became really different because we can we can see that.

26
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.060
Xiaoyang Song: there's a perfect overlap between the two between the habitat of these two species so by our calculation.

27
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.810
Xiaoyang Song: Your summer formula to overlap read over itself to point 97 this case.

28
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.780
Xiaoyang Song: Okay, so.

29
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.540
Xiaoyang Song: Based on that we can.

30
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:57.330
Xiaoyang Song: Do our analysis on our data set and here's the results um well, we can see this plot is the histogram of the distribution of Orange overlaps for other species and more data said.

31
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:09.240
Xiaoyang Song: In general, about 47% of specious pair have arranged overlap greater than point eight well 54% on average over overlap greater than Point five.

32
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:23.340
Xiaoyang Song: So, also from the histogram becomes observed that well out of battery and symmetric bossy both exist in this case on it, since there are no and dominates the others so.

33
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:35.670
Xiaoyang Song: it's it's quite an amazing result for us and we can also observed that the pattern of speciation varies across the claim.

34
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:54.330
Xiaoyang Song: And the relationship between a range overlap and also know, he also varies across species and this to plots are the example of this, for example, for a chorus vicious we can for one of the core species on the.

35
00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:05.700
Xiaoyang Song: shows highly our poetry, because of the low level of regional APP for for scallops they exhibit exhibit the.

36
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.810
Xiaoyang Song: high degree of sin Patrick because of their loss of.

37
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.640
Xiaoyang Song: Species who shows a high range overlap.

38
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.430
Xiaoyang Song: yep and.

39
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:30.720
Xiaoyang Song: For a comparison study, if there are some predecessors this few who tried to determine the speciation mechanisms for some birds and vertebrates you'll see an orange overlaps in Asia node.

40
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:45.660
Xiaoyang Song: Which are kind of similar to our study, for example, we can see the two plus on the red hand side on this shows highly our pantries for this two species because of the we can.

41
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.400
Xiaoyang Song: Because of.

42
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:58.650
Xiaoyang Song: What well good plus shows um yeah but it's kind of quite different from our result in this study from a risk species because.

43
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:07.650
Xiaoyang Song: This plot is on the original exhibit the relationship between range overlap and know days for our core data set.

44
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:23.730
Xiaoyang Song: We can see it's kind of a have a have a have for added pageantry f4 angel read up of one angel run up to, or so out of Petraeus and make sure you are both important in our study.

45
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:33.390
Xiaoyang Song: Well, in their study wanted out of pageantry painter exhibit so is correct, different, even though it used to submit.

46
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:47.040
Xiaoyang Song: And then the other interesting thing about the renewal roadmap for really oh species, we observed that there exists a perfect overlap, which means the original roadmap is one.

47
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:57.480
Xiaoyang Song: For really all species for those kinds of species, we expect that the time is really long and it's long enough for real speciation signal to disappear.

48
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:08.460
Xiaoyang Song: So, because of the influence of the migration we're ocean current we may expect a random kind of randomly distribution of the range over it up for those kinds of species.

49
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.630
Xiaoyang Song: So our explanation is that.

50
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:20.460
Xiaoyang Song: The reason why out of Patrick speciation it's less likely to occur in the ocean, is that many marine animals too.

51
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:43.740
Xiaoyang Song: Many American species have strong disperse abilities so yeah because there's no absolute barriers in the ocean so other than that, instead of geographic factors ecological factors are argued as a main driving force in the ocean and speciation really occur under different.

52
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.870
Xiaoyang Song: Conditions.

53
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.250
Xiaoyang Song: yeah.

54
00:08:48.330 --> 00:09:00.690
Xiaoyang Song: For the more fun that symmetric speciation is sometimes faster than the outer Patrick speciation because that selection can establish reproductive barrier which is really important for native state.

55
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.730
Xiaoyang Song: machine much more rapid than genetic genetic drift.

56
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.800
Xiaoyang Song: So after over conclusion.

57
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:19.260
Xiaoyang Song: They found out to some Patrick speciation is indeed the head of speciation mechanisms for many invertebrates and mammals in the ocean.

58
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:28.830
Xiaoyang Song: However, the speciation mechanisms for really oh species for miss unknown because of the last of real speciation the signal.

59
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:39.450
Xiaoyang Song: Also, increasing importance of sin petrol or late may lead to more frequent speciation which kind of contradicts with the fact that.

60
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:48.300
Xiaoyang Song: ocean has lower about diversity than deland but here to interpretations that they make for to this contradiction.

61
00:09:48.960 --> 00:10:02.400
Xiaoyang Song: The first interpretation is that it may because this contradiction may just because our Patrick speciation is less likely to occur in the ocean messin Petrie happens frack frequently mean both Ocean and the land.

62
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:16.200
Xiaoyang Song: So the other interpretation or explanation for the contradiction is that on the speciation mechanisms is now the dominant factor that influence the biodiversity so.

63
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.620
Xiaoyang Song: Basically, death all my presentation, thank you all.
